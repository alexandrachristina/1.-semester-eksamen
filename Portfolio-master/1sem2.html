  <figcaption class="description"> This is how my website looked in the first place. I took a lot from the prototype, but at the same time I changed a lot of things, because I didn't like the first design I made.
  I didn't get as much done as I wanted to, but I knew I would catch up on it later.

  <p class="feedback_text">
    - Very creative with the triangle. <br> <br>
    - The "education" page is really good. <br> <br>
    - Could change "about me" to "about" and "my work" to work.
  </p>

  <h2 class="changes_overskrift">Changes after the feedback</h2>

  <figcaption class="changes_text">I didn't actually change anything after I got the feedback, because I knew we were going to work on the website later on. I wrote down the feedback, so I wouldn't forget it. <br> <br>
  The new version looks a lot different. I chose to change the "about me" to "about" - it has a better sound to it.
   I got tired of the triangle and chose to remove it and add a logo instead. I also changed the layout and added some colors to my colorscheme. Some nice photos were added, and now the site looks a lot better and more "professional" than before.
