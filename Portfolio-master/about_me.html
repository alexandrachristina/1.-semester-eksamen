  <div class="box-1">
    <p class="about_me_1">My name is Alexandra, I'm 24 years old and I live in Denmark.
I grew up in a small city in Jutland and moved to Copenhagen 1,5 years ago.
<br> <br> I speak Danish, English and Russian fluently and I know a little bit German and Spanish.

  <p class="about_me_2">A couple of years ago I was in nursing school. I studied there for 1,5 years, but realised that I don't want to be a nurse. <br>
After that I couldn't figure out what I wanted to do in life. <br>
<br>
At some point I realised that I want to try myself with something creative. That's why I chose this education.<br>
Here you learn so many different things - about websites, to design, about photography, etc. I think it's great to know a little about everything and then delve into a specific topic that interests you the most. </p>

<div class="box-3">
  <p class="about_me_3"> In my freetime I enjoy photographing. I've been doing this for quite some years. <br>
  It started with photos of the sky and the nature on my iPhone 4, and then I got into portrait photography 2,5 years ago. That was also when I bought my first camera. <br> <br>
  Other than that I like to read, play the piano and spend time with my loved ones.

  <p class="about_me_4">All in all, I’m a positive, detail-oriented person, who’s really excited about life and everything it brings.
    <br> <br> I’m always passionate about the things I’m working on and I’m a quick learner, <br> which definitely gives me some leverage in different situations.
