  <section class=projektbeskrivelse>
  <h2 class="projektbeskrivelse_overskrift">Project description</h2>
  <p class="projektbeskrivelse_tekst">In this flow we had to construct a prototype for a mobile app in Adobe Xd. This project was in groups. <br> <br>
  We had to choose a company or organization and imagine that we had to construct an app for them. An important element of this app: We had to incooperate one or more of UN's Sustainable Development Goals.
  A big focus in this project was teamwork and groupwork.

  <figcaption class="description">We chose to focus on the 12th Goal - Responsible Consumption and Production. We made this app for Red Cross and called it "Røde Kors Genbrugs App". <br><br>
    Our goal and the concept: We want to grow the interest for second hand shopping by making it easier to shop second hand. The app works like Trendsales, but the big difference is that the money goes to charity.

    - A good result. <br> <br>
    - You got around everything. <br> <br>
    - You used 2 minutes more than you should. <br> <br>
    - Does the recycle wheel have to be there? Red Cross is already about recycling. <br> <br>
    - The colors reminds us of Christmas. <br> <br>
    - Don't forget about the target audience, when you use the Think aloud Protocol.

  <figcaption class="changes_text">
    For us the biggest bummer was the fact that the app reminds people of Christmas, but I still think it should keep it's original colors. <br> First of all, because we can't be sure, that the comparison isn't because Christmas is right around the corner. Second og all, because it would be silly to change the colors of two logos that actually exist - green is for recycle and red is Red Cross' color.  <br> <br>
    I did decide to make one change - I made the footer smaller. It was too big compared to everything else on the page, and a footer shouldn't be that big.
