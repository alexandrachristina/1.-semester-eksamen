  <p class="projektbeskrivelse_tekst">In this flow we have to redesign our portfolio from flow 2, update the content of the portfolio and document the process of this project.<br>
  We have to use everything we've learned this semester and show our skills through the portfolio and the documentation. So the portfolio has to show what we can and what we know.</p>

  <figcaption class="description"> The portfolio website you're on right now, is my final product. I'm pretty happy about it and it turned out just the way I imagined it. <br> <br>
    I've made a seperate PDF for the project. In the PDF you'll find more information about the styling and my process of making this new version of the website. (See below)
    <br> <br> On this page I'll share the main points of the project. <br> <br>

    <h2>Usertest</h2>
    <p>I made 3 usertests where I asked the users to click around the website and think out load. The main comments were: <br>
      - The website is very manageable. <br><br>
      - The front page is empty and boring - maybe add some pictures. <br><br>
      - "About" needs some more information, maybe some more about your background. Also, it would be easier to read if it wasn't devided like that. <br><br>
      - The pictures on "my work" don't look good together. <br><br>
      - You could change the layout on "education" - maybe so that the flows appear in a list when you hover over the semester.</p>

      <h2>Planning</h2>
      <p>I started out planning the whole project. <br>
      First I brainstormed, then I made a list of the things I wanted to include in my project, and at last I made a Gantt-chart and a WBS. I also made a sitemap, a flowchart and a wireframe. You can see them here:<br><br></p>
      <h4 class="seportknap"><a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/25dd7299-83db-45f3-bee6-ee4c4aa31d72-708e/">See PBS, WBS, etc.</a></h4> <br> <br>

      <h2>Sketches</h2>
      <p>These are the sketches I made for the new version of the website. <br></p>
      <img class="skitse" src="img/tegning.png" alt="a drawing/sketch of my website">
      <img class="skitse" src="img/tegning1.png" alt="a drawing/sketch of my website">

      <h2>Layout and Style</h2>
      <p>My portfolio website is supposed to reflect me as a person and at the same time show my schoolprojects and my progress through the semesters. This is all because the target audience are future employers or customers, who would like to work with me. <br> <br>

      I like minimalism and I like when things are "looking aestetic". I think it's important that a portfolio looks simple, but good - in that way it'll get peoples attention.


      <br> <br>
      It has to be easy to navigate between pages on my website. I've tried to make it simple, but still good looking. I changed the "about" page, so that it looks more interesting. I added more pictures of me, so that the visitor, in a way, knows me better, because he has seen me "from different angles". <br><br>
      Even though the "education" page was easy to navigate on, I chose to change it. It looks a lot better now, that I've seperated the semesters. The mock-ups for every semester makes it look a lot more interesting.
      </p>



      <h2>The Design</h2>
      <p> I wanted my website to look minimalistic, classy and aestetic. That is why I havent used bright colors, but tried to use very neutral colors instead. I also tried not to fill it up with too much text, photos, etc. to have a fair amount of white space.</p>

      <h3>Colors</h3>
        <p>My background color is beige - #E7D7CA, since I wanted something neutral that wasn't too bright. <br>
        After I'd picked my background color, I went to www.coolors.co to find a palette with #E7D7CA in it. <br> <br></p>
        <img class="palette" src="img/helefarvepalette.png" alt="colorscheme">
        <br>

        <p>That way I'm sure that the colors match each other. <br> <br>
        My colorscheme looks like this:<br></p>
        <img class="palette" src="img/farvepalette.jpg" alt="colorscheme">
          <br>
        <p>I chose these colors from the palette in which #E7D7CA was. <br>
        I used #B7B7A4 as a secondary color on the page, and then I used #DDBEA9 and #F0EFEB as additional colors for some of the boxes. This makes the pages more interesting, since it makes them less homogenous.<br>
        Other than that I've used black and white for the menubar and for the text. </p>



      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <p class="flow5_overskrift"> Headline:</p>
      <p>Old version: 'Epilogue' <br></p>
      <img class="headline_body" src="img/headlineold.png" alt="screenshot of text">
      <br>
      <p>New version: 'News Cycle'. Regular 400. <br>  </p>
      <img class="headline_body" src="img/headlinenew.png" alt="screenshot of text">
      <br>
      <p>I wanted the headlines to be a sans-serif since they look more minimalistic than serif types. I didn't find Epilogue simple enough, so I used Google Fonts to find af new type, that looks more minimalistic.</p>

      <p class="flow5_overskrift">
        Body Text:</p>
      <p>Old version: 'Helvetica'. <br>  </p>
      <img class="headline_body" src="img/bodyold.png" alt="screenshot of text">
      <br>
      <p>New version: 'Old Standard TT' 400 Regular. <br></p>
      <img class="headline_body" src="img/bodynew.png" alt="screenshot of text">
      <br>
      <p>I chose a serif type for the body text, because it's easier to read. The serifs makes it easier for us to read long texts, since they help us seperate the letters. <br> <br>

      For the menubar I chose to keep 'Epilogue'. </p>

      <h2>Logo</h2>
      <p>On my old website I didn't really have a logo. I had the big triangle, which kind of worked as a logo. It looked odd and I think a logo is good for personal branding, so I made a logo in illustrator. <br>
        Here is my skecth: <br></p>
        <img class="logoskitse" src="img/logotegning.png" alt="screenshot of tegning">
        <img class="logoskitse1" src="img/logotegning1.png" alt="screenshot of tegning"> <br>
        <p>I wanted to use the letters from my name - A and C. I'm trying to tell people that I'm creative, that I have a lot of ideas - therefore the lines. They illustrate the light that is coming from a light bulb. Light bulb = "I've got an idea" - so it's illustrating that I'm a creative person.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>This is the final logo:</p> <br>
        <img class="logo" src="img/logo.png" alt="screenshot of tegning"> <br>
        <p>Read the thoughts and the process behind the logo in the examproject PDF.</p>

        <h2>Video</h2>
        <p>Already from the begining I knew I wanted the video to be on my front page. In that way it'll set the mood from the begning and people will get an insight into who I am and what I do. </p>
        <br>
        <img class="videoscreen" src="img/screenofvideo.png" alt="screenshot of my video"> <br>
        See the storyboard and read about the process in the PDF.

  <section class="feedback">
  <h2 class="change_overskrift">Changes in flowprojects</h2>

  <div class="boxflowchange"><h3 class="flowh3">Flow 1</h3>
  <p class="flowchange"> I haven't changed anything but the front page - after the feedback I got. I don't think there's any reason to change a prototype that isn't going to be used anymore. My website doesn't even look like that anymore.
  </p>
<br>
<h4 class="gotoflow"><a href="1sem1.html">Go to flow 1</a></h4>

  <div class="boxflowchange"><h3 class="flowh3">Flow 2</h3>
  <p class="flowchange"> I'm automatically changing this flowproject by making a new version of the website. In that way the changes of flow 2 is actually flow 5. </p><br>
    <h4 class="gotoflow"><a href="1sem2.html">Go to flow 2</a></h4>
   <br></div>

   <div class="boxflowchange">
     <h3 class="flowh3">Flow 3</h3>
   <p class="flowchange"> I'm really happy with the app we made, so I didn't change anything else but the footer. It was too big, especially for an app, so I made it smaller.  </p><br>
    <h4 class="gotoflow"><a href="1sem3.html">Go to flow 3</a></h4>
    <br></div>

    <div class="boxflowchange"><h3 class="flowh3">Flow 4</h3>
    <p class="flowchange"> I've changed the name of the page from "Fra Bog til Ide" to "Fra Bog til Træ", since this is the correct name of our campagne. <br>
      I've also straighten out the photo of the manager, since it didn't look natural or good. <br><br>
      I did also try to change the colors of the website, but ended up going back to the original colors, since that looked better. <br> When we were making the landingpage we wanted to keep it simple and without any "extra" things. In that way nothing distracts the visitor from the message of the landingpage.</p> <br>

  <h2 class="learned_overskrift">What I've learned in this flow</h2>
  <p class="learned_text"> <b>In this flow I learned:</b> <br> <br>
    - To make my own project. <br> <br>
    - To think every little detail through before I start doing anything. <br> <br>
    - To understand and use tools like PBS, WBS, wireframe, etc. independently (not in a group). <br> <br>
    - To have a reason, an argument, for my design choices. <br> <br>
    - To look at my projects and be critical about them - try to make an improvement.
